## Description

The app should be a clock-in/out screen that will:

- Allow a user to enter their name or log in
- Allow the user to clock either in or out
- Upon clock event, store this information
- Provide a list of all clock events with logged information

Additional considerations:

- A teacher may need to clock in/out multiple times a day (e.g., for lunch)
- A clock event may need to be edited or deleted
- Are there any validations or UI constraints.

## Approach

<TODO>

How did you approach this challenge?
What schema design did you choose and why?

## Backlog

If you were given another day to work on this, how would you spend it? What if you were given a month?

- User profile section - User profile controller
- Define user page permissions - different access between Admin, teacher, parents
- Write tests
- React refactor code (hooks)
